# RISC-V__SOC

This repository documents my journey and contributions to the **VSD RISC-V Tapeout Program**.

## 📌 Overview
- Implementation of a RISC-V based System-on-Chip (SoC)
- RTL design, synthesis, and verification
- Targeting tapeout through the VSD program

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `rtl/` → Verilog/SystemVerilog source code  
- `docs/` → Documentation, reports, and notes  
- `sim/` → Testbenches and simulation files  
- `scripts/` → Build and automation scripts  

## 🚀 Goals
- Understand the complete flow from RTL to GDSII  
- Learn open-source EDA tools (OpenLane, Sky130 PDK, etc.)  
- Successfully tapeout a working RISC-V SoC  

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- OpenLane  
- Yosys  
- Magic  
- SkyWater 130nm PDK
